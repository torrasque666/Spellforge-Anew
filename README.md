# Spellforge-Anew
Spellforge Anew is an easy to use Spell sheet creator for Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 edition. Rather than have to spend a lengthy amount of time selecting which spells to use for your characters, this allows you easily select and format a spell sheet.

<h2>How can you help?</h2>
I'm not too proud to beg. I can always use help. Once I get the spell selection sheets ready, it will be easy(ier) to add new spells, but adding new spells is a tedious and time consuming effort, though not particularly difficult. However, in the mean time, I will be primarily working on the Spells side of things, but Psionics will need help creating a selection sheet that works better than the current.... mess.
